# PDB-Match-V1
PDB Batch v1 is an interactive bioinformatics tool for deep structural and mutational comparison of wild-type and mutant proteins using PDB files. It detects insertions, deletions, and substitutions, visualizes mutations in-sequence, performs physicochemical and Ramachandran analyses, and integrates PolyPhen-2 and SIFT workflows.
